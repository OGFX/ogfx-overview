A high level overview of the OGFX project.

# Rationale

Since the new Raspberry Pi4 dropped we were amazed to find that it finally offers a working USB3 host which can drive an USB class audio 2.0 device. 

The system image is based on nixos/nixpkgs. The code to reproduce them can be found in the other repos in the OGFX organization.

The OGFX project aims to combine readily available software and easy to build hardware into a hackable, nerd-friendly, usable guitar effects platform.
